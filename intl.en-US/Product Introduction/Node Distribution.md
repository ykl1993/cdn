## Configure nodes {#section_uj3_dr2_zdb .section}

-   The system configures and adjusts Chinese nodes by default for the domain name you have added. \(For more information, see distribution of specific node.\)

-   At the same time, the system automatically adds corresponding mainland China node based on the access condition.

-   The system does not add overseas nodes by default. Submit a ticket to apply for outside-China CDN service if necessary, as long as you are an L3 or L4 VIP. [Learn more about Alibaba Cloud membership benefits.](https://club.aliyun.com/?accounttraceid)
